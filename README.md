# Tea Cozy Project
*A Project by Jeff Vergne*

This project is part of the **Fullstack Engineer Career** path from **CodeCademy**

## Objective
In this project, I am going to develop afake tea company website. This is a project linked to the flexbox lesson, so I guess that wrapping, flex directions, flex-grows and flex-shrinks will be part of the fun here.
This is a *from scratch* project (except for the images), entirely written by my hands.
In order to know what to do, I followed this [specification document](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg).

## Technology
Written in HTML5 CSS3
